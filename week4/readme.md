Open { at the start means it is a dictionary

You can index data and pull out individual pieces of data in steps
e.g data["results"][0]["name"]["title"] will produce data pulling the "title" from "name" in the first data set which is inside "results" 

To count a range backwards, reverse the order of the numbers and add a negative step size (big number, small number, - step size)

if r.status_code is 200: means the url is working

request.get() will retrieve data from a specified address

By initally setting a non-existant value, a function can be kick started

open("file address", "r") will read the file (r)

open("file address", "w") will write in the file (w), if the file path does not exist, a new one will be created with a specified name.

data = f_gcode.readlines(), reads the data line by line

Windows style line endings: \n starts a new line (although it does not show up in the text, the code will still read it)
